# Pattern-Problem-Solutions-in-CPP-
This repository contains the solution of pattern problems available on this site: https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/must-do-pattern-problems-before-starting-dsa/ .
I know solutions are there on that website itself but the code here is written without taking any help or hints from internet or anywhere else. So feel free to use whatever you want.
The code is written in C++ using very basic logical and primitive approach. Therefore, the code might not be optimal. Feel free to contact if code doesn't works on the website. All the problem solutions are in this single file. On the website same function names were used for different questions so, the function names might be little bit changed in the code. This was done to avoid duplicate function names since, parameters were same i.e. function overloading can't be used. The functions might be commented so de-comment them to do the working. I hope this helped!!
